/**
 * A repository for managing scheduled executor jobs in a relational database. This class provides methods
 * to create, read, update, and delete job entries stored in a database table. Each job entry contains details
 * such as the job's name, initial delay, execution period, time unit, and the timestamp of when it was scheduled.
 * <p>
 * The table can either use a default name or a custom {@code sharedTableName} provided at instantiation, and the table structure
 * is validated or created if it does not exist.
 * <p>
 * If a custom {@code sharedTableName} is provided then it is validated using {@link PostgresqlUtil#checkIsValidTableOrColumnName(String)} as an initial layer
 * of defense against SQL injection by applying naming conventions intended to reduce the risk of malicious input.<br>
 * However, Essentials components does not offer exhaustive protection, nor does it ensure the complete security of the resulting SQL against SQL injection threats.<br>
 * <b>The responsibility for implementing protective measures against SQL Injection lies exclusively with the users/developers using the Essentials components and its supporting classes.</b><br>
 * Users must ensure thorough sanitization and validation of API input parameters, column, table, and index names.<br>
 * Insufficient attention to these practices may leave the application vulnerable to SQL injection, potentially endangering the security and integrity of the database.<br>
 * <br>
 * It is highly recommended that the {@code sharedTableName} value is only derived from a controlled and trusted source.
