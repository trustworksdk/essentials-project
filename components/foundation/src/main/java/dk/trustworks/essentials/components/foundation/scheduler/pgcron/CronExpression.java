/**
 * Represents a cron expression used for scheduling periodic tasks.
 * This class provides a strongly typed wrapper for cron expression strings, improving
 * code readability and type-safety when working with cron-based scheduling systems.
 * <p>
 * A cron expression is a string consisting of five or six fields, separated by white
 * space, representing a set of times defined by the string's syntax. For example,
 * "* * * * *" represents executing a task every minute, and "0 0 * * *" represents
 * executing a task every day at midnight.
 * <p>
 * Defined constants are available for common scheduling intervals:
 * - {@link #ONE_SECOND}: Represents a job scheduled every second.
 * - {@link #TEN_SECOND}: Represents a job scheduled every ten seconds.
 * - {@link #ONE_MINUTE}: Represents a job scheduled every minute.
 * - {@link #ONE_HOUR}: Represents a job scheduled every hour.
 * - {@link #ONE_DAY}: Represents a job scheduled every day.
